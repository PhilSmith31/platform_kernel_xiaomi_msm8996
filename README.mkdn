EAS Kernel for Xiaomi Mi5
===========

For my personal usage only (and testing), everyone is free to use it, but do not report me bugs/issues because personal usage means... Personal usage :)
-----------

Compiling instructions (python2 is needed):

1 - Create an empty directory and cd into it

    mkdir the_name_you_want && cd the_name_you_want

2 - Create a new folder in the_name_you_want named Ramdisk-Gemini and put the ROM ramdisk into it

3 - Clone the kernel repo and cd into it

    git clone https://github.com/B--B/B--B-Kernel.git && cd B--B-Kernel

4 - Build the kernel (the flashable zip can be found in B--B directory)

    ./build_kernel.sh


Other scripts:

    ./clean-all.sh --> clean all generated files
    ./clean_kernel.sh --> runs mrproper and reload kernel config
    ./load_config.sh --> load the defconfig used for compiling
    ./menu.sh --> load the menuconfig for defconfig edits
